I made a social media Dashbord using typescript!!
Peer reviewer: Jeriah Marson
Peer review: The over all format is good and the light and dark mode works but the size of the boxes is a bit off but can be fixed in time, also the font is not the correct.
It is responsive
Could be perfected further but the lay out is generally correct and the information is all displayed in the correct location
